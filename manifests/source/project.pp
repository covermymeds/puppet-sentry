  # We use the full combination of org/team/project because
  # the same project name might exist in different organizations
  # or teams.
  #
  # We use `if ! defined` here because we don't want catalog
  # compilation to fail in the event that a project's platform
  # changes for any reason. Such a change might be due to an
  # unexpected error, or by intentional operator decision.
